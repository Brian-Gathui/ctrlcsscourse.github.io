# Web Platform Development Course Work 2 Final

The following files comprise the course work 2 from one of my classes Web Platform Development 1 at ALU (African Leadership University) for my BSc (Hons) Computing Degree.

1) We were tasked with designing a website to help the next cohort of students learn CSS. The site should have an introductory page giving a brief overview of the aims of the site.   
2) This page should allow access to a quiz and a Contact page.   
3) The site will require a clearly laid out interface and an attractive design to keep students engaged. 

Below is a link to the development plan of the website. I used Figma to create the design. Figma is a vector-based graphics editor that is used for web design, prototyping, and UI/UX design. I thought that it was the best tool for me to fully realize my vision for my website. I tried my best to stick to the original design as much as possible, but there are some changes I made for the better. 

Here is the shareable link to my design:  https://www.figma.com/file/xM9czoN8iBeAAKXeTTKXmu/Web-Platform-Development-Coursework-2?node-id=0%3A1 

Included in the files is a full descriscription of the course work 2 as well a report detailing the thought process of my design within a word document.
