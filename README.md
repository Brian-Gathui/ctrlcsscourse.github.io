The following files comprise the final coursework from one of my classes Web Platform Development 1 at ALU (African Leadership University) for my BSc (Hons) Computing Degree.

1) Tasked with designing a website to help the next cohort of students learn CSS. The site should have an introductory page giving a brief overview of the aims of the site.   
2) This page should allow access to a quiz and a Contact page.   
3) The site will require a clearly laid out interface and an attractive design to keep students engaged.
